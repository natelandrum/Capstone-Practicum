        <div class="step-card">
            <h3>üìò Testimony Insight Journaling</h3>
            <p>Each week, I will dedicate 30 minutes to reading scriptures or conference talks focused on testimony. I will select one key insight each week and write it down to reflect on throughout the week.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step-card">
            <h3>ü§ù Faith-Building Action</h3>
            <p>Once per week, I will take one action to strengthen or share my testimony. This may include sharing my testimony with a friend, writing it in a journal, or bearing testimony during family home evening or in another setting.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step-card">
            <h3>üîç Addressing Doubts with Faith</h3>
            <p>If a doubt arises, I will dedicate up to 30 minutes that week to seek answers through prayer, scripture study, or trusted sources like conference talks. I will record my learning experience in a testimony journal.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step-card">
            <h3>üôè Weekly Reflection and Prayer</h3>
            <p>At the end of each week, I will reflect on how my testimony has grown. I will offer a prayer of gratitude for the insights and growth I have experienced.</p>

    <h2>Impact of Application Project</h2>
    <p>
        Applying the principle of taking charge of my testimony has impacted my spiritual growth and confidence. By actively seeking to strengthen my testimony each week, I have developed a deeper understanding of gospel principles and a stronger relationship with Jesus Christ. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Reflecting on my experiences and insights has allowed me to see how small, consistent efforts lead to significant spiritual growth. Addressing doubts with faith rather than fear has given me greater clarity and peace. Sharing my testimony with others has increased my confidence and strengthened my resolve to live according to gospel principles. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This project has helped me see my testimony as something dynamic and alive, requiring regular nourishment and care. Through this process, I have learned that faith is not static‚Äîit grows as I exercise it weekly and intentionally.
